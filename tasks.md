Home / About Us
• Provide an overview of the association, including its origin, key members, motto, vision, mission, core
values, and strategic direction.
Origin:
SOBA Ontario was founded in 2016 by a small group of forward-thinking individuals from the Class
of ’87, who resided in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada. The founding members included
Livinus Eleanya, Martin Mote, Elvis Nquenya, Gerald Muchu, and Armstrong Sache, who served as the
pioneer president. Initially formed as a close-knit community, the group’s evolving vision—driven by a
commitment to the well-being of Sobans and a deep attachment to their alma mater, Saint Joseph’s
College Sasse—led to a broader and more inclusive approach. When the organization was officially
launched in 2017, membership was extended to all alumni and staff of Sasse College residing in
Ontario. Today, SOBA Ontario is a registered not-for-profit organization under the Ontario Ministry of
Government and Consumer Services’ Not-for-Profit Corporations Act. It proudly counts over 30 active,
full-time members from across the province.

lifelong relationships with our fellow schoolmates, teachers, and the institution that brought us together.
